                        <h3>Why We Cook</h3>
                        <p>Ever wondered why we cook? Maybe you had a busy day, and you were too tired to cook, 
                            so you washed and sliced up all the vegetables in your fridge, added it to a bowl, and ate 
                            it. If so, you probably ended up with part of the answer.</p>
                            <p>Cooking food makes it taste better. Let me explain. </p>
                            <p>There are 2 main groups of flavor molecules; aroma molecules and taste molecules. There are
                            5 taste molecules: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. These are sensed by receptors on the 
                            tongue, whereas aroma molecules float to the back of the nose, when we chew food. There are near
                            infinitely many aroma molecules. Aroma molecules have to be very small to float on air. Because 
                            of this we might say that they are volatile, meaning they evaporate readily.</p>
                            <p>If you've ever tried to hold your nose when eating a food, you really don't like, you might 
                            have noticed that it isn't completely effective. A famous experiment blindfolded people and had 
                            them hold their notes while eating pieces of apple onion and potato. The tasters are told to guess
                            which of the three foods they are eating. The foods tend to taste similar until they are about to 
                            be swallowed. Then, aroma receptors sense the food passing through, you get the final identity 
                            confirmation. If the taster has a cold, the receptors in both the note and mouth are blocked, causing
                            all food to taste bland </p>
                            <p>Fats, proteins are carbohydrates are very large in comparison to taste and flavor molecules.  This 
                            means that they are unable to bind to taste receptors on the tongue and produce very little flavor. 
                            However, cooking can break down these macromolecules into flavor molecules.Because fats, proteins, 
                            and carbohydrates are so large, they provide texture to food.</p>

                                <li>1 TBSP apple cider vinegar</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Blackberry filling</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>4 cups of blackberries</li>
                                <li>2 cups of rhubarb/sliced apples</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Directions</h2>
                            <h3>for the pie crust</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Grate frozen butter into flour. Mix to coat butter with flour.</li>
                                <li>Add water. Using a rubber spatula, fold and press dough until it comes together. 
                                Divide ball in half. Form each half into a disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 30 min
                                to 2 hours before rolling and baking.</li>
                                <li>When ready to shape the dough, pull out one ball, set it on a floured work surface, and sprinkle 
                                with flour. Roll dough out into a circle using a rolling pin. The finished dough should overhang
                                your pie plate by an inch or two.</li>
                                <li>Pick up the dough and unroll it over a pie plate. Fit the dough into the pie plate.</li>
                                <li>Use scissors to trim  dough so it overhangs the edge by 1/2 inch all around. </li>
                                <li>Freeze an additional round of dough up to 1 month or repeat step 3 and use it to top your pie.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Parbake crust:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Line crust with parchment paper and weigh it down with something. I like to use baby carrots,
                                that way I can eat them while I'm waiting.</li>
                                <li>Bake at 350 for 15 min or until golden brown.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li>Fill parbaked crust with 4 cups blackberries and 2 cups apples/rhubarb.</li>
                                <li>Bake at 350 for 40 min</li>
                                <li>Cool for 10 min, then serve. Eat plain, or with a dollop of cream or ice cream</li>

                    <h4>Water</h4>
                    <p>Have you ever heard that the secret to a good pie is to keep the butter impossibly cold? You dip your
                    hands in ice cold water just to make the perfect pie crust. This is because as the pie bakes, water in 
                    the butter evaporates, creating perfect layers.  
                    <p>Vegetables and fruits often contain 85% water or more. Even steak is 75% water by weight. Water is
                    a key determinant in what happens to food when we eat it.</p>
                </aside>
                <aside>
                    <h4>What is a calorie </h4>
                    <p>Calories are not the end all be all. They are a unit of energy, but don't determine exactly how that
                    energy is used. More specifically the calorie is the energy it takes to raise the temperature of 1 cubic
                    centimeter of water by 1-degree Celsius. Food calories are not actually calories, they're kilocalories. 
                    That is why they are spelled with a capital C. </p>
                    <p>The most accurate way to determine the calorie content of food is to burn it and use the resulting
                    energy to heat up some water. A bomb calorimeter is the machine we use to do just that.</p>
                </aside>
                <aside>
                    <h4>A note on measurements</h4>
                    <p>Generally, using grams as opposed to cups will yield much more precise results. The volume that is in a cup
                    can vary based on manufacturers and country. Take a cup measure and fill it with water. After zeroing or subtracting
                    the weight of the cup, the water should weigh about 236g. Let us know in the comments what you got.  
                    <p>Nevertheless, your average cookie or scone recipe is forgiving enough that using measurements in 
                    volume should yield good results. Plus, many households do not own a kitchen scale. </p>
