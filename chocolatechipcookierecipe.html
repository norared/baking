                <h3>Time is of the Essence</h3>
                <p>If you've ever taken a general chemistry course, you'd know that there is quite
                a lot of math involved. Math is how we prove concepts in chemistry.  
                That is why I was very excited when I came across this equation: 
                L^2=4Dt </p>
                <p>Karl Pearson, a great statician introduced the idea of the random walk. 
                He described a drunkard's walks as: if a person flips a coin, and it comes 
                up heads the person steps to the left. If it comes up tails, they step to 
                the right. What he didn't know is that this question had been answered twice
                in the preceding years.  </p>
                <p>Einstein had been studying milk. In milk, the fat globules of milk move around
                randomly. Random movement of small particles is called Brownian motion. He reasoned
                that this motion is because the fat globules are mumping into each other. The motion
                would be very similar to the random walk.  </p>
                <p>Louis Bachelier was interested in the movement of stock prices. He created a model
                for how stock prices move with time, assuming they do so randomly. Unfortunately for him,
                the movement of stock prices is much more complicated.  </p>
                <p>In the end, all three men came up with the same mathematical description: L^2=4Dt <p>
                <p>D is the diffusion coefficient in cm^2/sec, and it varies based on different materials, 
                l is the distance that the diffusion front has moved in cm, and t is time in seconds </p>
                <p>Most foods have similar diffusion coefficients, notably they are all close to water which
                has D=0.0014cm2 per sec, meaning you can simply use D=0.0014 in your calculations. </p>
                <p>There is a mathematical law that tells us exactly how long to cook our food!  </p>
                <p>The recipe I used says to cook your cookie for 10 minutes. Let us plug this in for
                time and use it to calculate the crumb of our cookie (the crumb being the solid part). 
                The calculated crumb should take up the entire height of the cookie, we don't want our 
                cookie to be liquid on the inside. </p>
                <p>L=Sqrt(4*0.0014(cm^2/sec)*600sec) </p>
                <p>L=1.833cm </p>
                <p>This means that the crumb of our cookie could extend up to 1.833 cm. I imagine that our
                cookie should be 1cm-2cm high. Likely, this means that the cookie is cooked all the way through 
                from all directions. Probably not a very gooey cookie.  </p>
                <p>I will leave you to experiment using this formula, to create your idea of a perfect cookie.
                Do you want it cooked rock solid (I know I do) or will you leave it gooey on the inside? </p>
                <p>Use the contact page at the top of my website to share your results, I would love to hear them. </p>

                <h2>Chocolate chip cookies recipe</h2>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
                    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                    <li>2 tsp hot water</li>
                    <li>&frac12; tsp salt</li>
                    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
                    <li>1 cup of chopped nuts/seeds</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Beat in eggs one at a time.</li>
                    <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water.</li>
                    <li>Add baking soda+ water to batter along with salt</li>
                    <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, nuts/seeds of your choice</li>
                    <li>Bake in preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. How does this compare to your time estimate?</li>

                    <h4>Ratios</h4>
                    <p> In general cookies are 2 parts flour, 2 parts fat, and 1 part sugar by weight and 3 parts flour, 2 parts fat,
                    and 1 part sugar by volume. You can utilize these ratios to experiment on your own.   </p>
            </aside>
            <aside>
                    <h4>Caramelization</h4>
                    <p>Caramelization occurs when high heat causes sugar molecules to break down into flavor compounds.
                    Caramelization gives cookies a sweet, nutty flavor. It occurs above 356F, meaning that very little
                    caramelization will occur in this recipe. </p>
            </aside>
            <aside>
                    <h4>Leavening</h4>
                    <p>As your cookie heats up, water turns into steam, causing the cookie to expand. This water escapes the
                    cookie, turning it solid and flakey.</p>
                    <p>Sodium bicarbonate reacts with acids in the dough to form carbon dioxide. This also contributes to the leavening.</p>
            </aside>
            <aside>
                    <h4>calibrating your oven</h4>
                    <p>Often foods will make a drastic transformation once they reach a specific temperature. For 
                    example sugar will melt at almost exactly 187C or 365F. Remember that temperature is the average
                    kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance,  meaning sugar can melt at stighly heigher or lower
                    temperatures. Nevertheless, put a tray full of sugar into the oven at 355F and then 375F for 15 min.
                    Then replace sugar and  try at 360F and 370F. continue experiment until you find how much the calibration
                    of your oven is off. It will sometimes but rarely be off by more than 10 degreesF.</p>
