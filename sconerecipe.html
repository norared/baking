                <h3>An Introduction to Proteins </h3>
                <p>Proteins are incredibly important in cooking for their ability to break apart and reform.  
                <p>Proteins are long chains of amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in nature. 
                The acids are made up of a nitrate group, a carboxyl group and a carbon chain known as an R-group. In 
                chemistry and biology, we often refer to a carbon chain as an r-group. The R-group is what varies between
                different types of proteins 
                <p>Many control circuits in biology are designed to keep proteins functioning under different conditions, 
                but in cooking, we modify proteins so they can't complete their original function 
                <p>Proteins are significant in cooking for their ability to break apart and reform.
                At high temperatures proteins wiggle/vibrate due to the heat, causing them to unfold. 
                The hydrophobic(water-fearing) residues will try to stick together as will the hydrophilic
                (water-loving) residues. An amino acid residue is just the word for an unbonded amino acid. 
                The residues on one protein form links with those on other proteins and a series of crosslinks emerge.  
                <p>What causes an egg to change form? The proteins unfold due to heat and then stick to each other because
                the exposed hydrophobic amino acids are sticky. For clarification, the proteins in an uncooked egg are curled
                up and not bonded to other proteins, when the egg is cooked, a series of crosslinks are created between the 
                different proteins. In a cooked egg different proteins are bonded to each other more often than in an uncooked egg.
                This is what causes an egg to become solid when cooked.  The transition in an egg, when it goes from liquid to solid 
                in called a gelation transition.  These unfolded proteins are why eggs are considered a binding agent, and why we added
                them to our scone.

                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups all purpose flour (use spoon and level method)</li>
                    <li>&frac23; cup of milk</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp allpe cider</li>
                    <li>&frac78; cup butter</li>
                    <li>1 TBSP baking powder</li>
                    <li> &frac12; tsp baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>1 TBSP sugar (if desired)</li>
                    <li>&frac14; cup chocolate chips and Â¼ cups nut/seeds/spinach of your choosing.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grate butter finely. Freeze for 5-10 min, but not more.</li>
                    <li>Mix wet ingredients (milk, egg, sugar)</li>
                    <li>Mix dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, baking soda)</li>
                    <li>Add butter into dry ingredients and dry ingredients into wet ingredients</li>
                    <li>Add &frac14; cup choc chips and &frac14; cups nuts/seeds/spinach.</li>
                    <li>Divide mixture evenly into 2 parts</li>
                    <li>Form/ roll 1 part of divided mixture into a ball</li>
                    <li>Fold in half 3-6 times to create nice layers</li>
                    <li>Roll it into a ball and flatten it. Cut it into 6 pieces and place on baking tray</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 7-9 with the 2nd half of the dough mixture.</li>
                    <li>Bake at 400F for 12-15 min or until golden brown</li>
                </ol>

                    <h4>Packing flour</h4>
                    <p>Have you ever made a recipe where the dough/ batter was too thick or thin? This may be because 
                    the amount of flour in a cup can vary greatly. The standard for how many milliliters is in a cup
                    can vary based on where you live. Sometimes manufacturers will draw the line randomly or inaccurately. 
                    In climates with more moisture in the air, flour will absorb more water, and it will condense, meaning
                    when you measure it, you are more likely to use too much. When you scoop into the bag of flour to fill
                    your cup, you pack it down further. You can use the spoon and level method to avoid this problem, but
                    often I have found that your recipe will have too little flour.  Personally, I feel it is more pleasant
                    to use less flour rather than more, which can turn a recipe solid and gritty. Regardless, the only way
                    to fix this problem is to buy a kitchen scale. Since I have not done so, I will say that most recipes are
                    forgiving enough that using a cup measurer will yield good results.</p>

                <h4>The Maillard's reactions</h4>
                <p>Ever eaten a piece of perfectly browned toast and wondered why it tasted so much better than toasted.
                The difference in flavor results from Maillard's reactions. The Maillard's reaction needs sugars, proteins and heat.
                The sugars and proteins react and create hundreds of different flavor molecules.</p>
                <p>The precise result depends on the amount and types of protein and sugar content. 
                Maillard's reactions occur very little below 120 degrees C or 248 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
                <p>Brushing your scone with egg or milk, thereby providing more protein (and in the case of milk, 
                more sugar will increase Maillard's reactions.)</p>
